# Overview
The primary objective of this project was to analyze a diverse dataset sourced from TidyTuesday, aiming to understand the key factors influencing early career pays of university graduates. It sought to explore correlations between various university attributes, such as STEM percentages, tuition fees and university types, and their impact on the salaries of graduates in their early careers.

# About the data
The dataset originates from TidyTuesday (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-03-10) and represents a merging of two primary datasets, tuition_cost.csv and salary_potential.csv. Comprising various university attributes, including early and mid-career pays, in-state and out-of-state tuition fees, university types (public, private, for-profit), and alumni perspectives on making a global impact, this dataset offers a diverse array of information. 

# Conclusions
Influential Factors: In the linear regression analysis, a positive correlation emerged between higher STEM percentages and increased early career pays. To deepen understanding, a multiple linear regression model was employed. Incorporating out-of-state tuition fees as a predictor significantly enhanced the comprehension of the variability in early career pays.

University Type Differences: The Wilcoxon rank-sum test, highlighted notable differences in early career pays between graduates of public and private universities. Early career pays were observed to be higher among graduates from private institutions in comparison to those from public universities.

# Overall insights
The analysis underlined the importance of certain university attributes, particularly STEM programs and tuition fees, in influencing early career pays. Moreover, it highlighted the differences in salary outcomes between graduates of public and private universities, providing valuable insights for prospective students in understanding the factors shaping early career salary prospects.
